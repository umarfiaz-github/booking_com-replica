# booking_com

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a mobile application developed using Flutter to replicate the UI and some functionality of the Booking.com app. The main focus was on creating a user-friendly interface for booking hotels, car rentals, and taxis.

Features
Home Page: UI replicating the Booking.com home page with options for "Stays", "Car Rental", "Taxi", and "Attractions".
Stays Page: Functional API integration for hotel searches.
Car Rental, Taxi, and Attractions Pages: UI implementation without backend functionality.
Profile Page: Basic profile page layout.
## API Integration:

API integration has been implemented for the "Stays" page. The app fetches hotel data using a secure method for handling API keys stored in a .env file.
